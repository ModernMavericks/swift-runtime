#   usage: . build/msc.sh
#          Sourced by a ModernMavericks product's build scripts: locates shipyard's scripts as
#          $SHIPYARD and exports SHIPYARD_SCRIPTS. In CI, install@v1 has already exported
#          SHIPYARD_SCRIPTS; anywhere else this asks shipyard-cmake -- the only cmake that configures
#          against shipyard -- where find_package(MavericksShipyard) lands, so a CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#          dev override moves the scripts together with the modules. About 2 s, exported so children
#          skip it. CANONICAL COPY: shipyard's scripts/templates/msc.sh; conventions check 17
#          requires every product's copy to match it byte for byte, so change it there, not here.
