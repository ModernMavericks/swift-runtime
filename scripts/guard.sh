# Project wrapper around mavericks-shipyard's assert_binary_compatible.sh.
# Encodes mavericks-swift's 10.9 policy and delegates to the shared guard:
#   - EXTEND the denylist to the full post-10.9 os_* family (underscore-robust; the
#     shared default only covers os_unfair_lock + os_log single-underscore).
#   - ALLOW those families ONLY when imported *weak* (the Swift runtime NULL-checks
#     them via SWIFT_RUNTIME_WEAK_CHECK). os_unfair_lock is deliberately NOT allowed:
#     the runtime calls it UNGUARDED, so it must be built out (pthreads/patch).
# Usage: scripts/guard.sh <dylib> [<dylib> ...]
