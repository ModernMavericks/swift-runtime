# build.sh — reproducible from-source build of libswiftCore for macOS 10.9 / x86_64.
#
# Produces: out/libswiftCore.dylib (+ libswiftSwiftOnoneSupport.dylib), minOS 10.9,
# from Swift 6.3.3 swift.org sources, with NO Apple prebuilt runtime bytes redistributed.
#
# Host: macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools (full Xcode NOT required), cmake + ninja + git.
# Cross-target build (host may be arm64; output is x86_64). ~30-60 min from clean on 8 cores.
#
# Everything is PINNED below. Do not float versions — the stdlib is coupled to its compiler.

# The host build environment (swiftlang LLVM build support + the swift.org toolchain) is built
# and published by ModernMavericks/swift-toolchain. We fetch it by pinned URL + SHA256 rather
# than building LLVM here. A CMake *build tree* bakes absolute paths into LLVMConfig.cmake at
# configure time, so a build that reuses one is only correct while the checkout path never
# moves -- and this repo's rename proved it does. The published tree is a CMake *install* tree,
# which derives its prefix from its own location; nothing here depends on cache state.

#  0001 unsized operator delete  — 10.9's libc++ lacks __ZdlPvm (sized delete).
#       Safe: IRGen (the only consumer needing sized dealloc) isn't built here.
#  0002 os-version 10.9 fallback — guards os_system_version_get_current_version
#       (macOS 10.10, called unguarded by the availability backing) with a
#       CoreFoundation plist fallback so `if #available` works instead of aborting
#       under 10.9's dyld. Turns an unguarded weak import into a guarded one.
#  0003 guard objc_readClassPair (macOS 10.11) in swift_instantiateObjCClass AND
#       do the minimal in-place objc4-532 realization of runtime-instantiated
#       generic classes when it is absent (calloc class_rw_t, RW_REALIZED,
#       rw->ro=ro, empty cache/vtable, install into data_NEVER_USE) so the ObjC
#       runtime can read/message them on 10.9. (Replaces the earlier broken "skip".)
#  0004 realization-aware getROData — objc4-532 realizes classes eagerly at image
#       load, so a class's Data word may be a class_rw_t; follow rw->ro when
#       RW_REALIZED is set. Both overloads. Fixes garbage ro reads on 10.9.
#  0005 objc-super instance size — in initClassFieldOffsetVector, on the
#       readClassPair-absent (10.9/10.10) runtime, size a subclass from
#       class_getInstanceSize(super) when the objc-super branch would otherwise
#       under-size it (static Swift super's is-swift bit not observed on 10.9).
#  0007 is-swift mask legacy bit — SWIFT_CLASS_IS_SWIFT_MASK=1 for sub-10.14.4
#       Apple targets. The 6.3.3 compiler tags static classes with the LEGACY
#       is-swift bit (bit 0 / value 1) when targeting <10.14.4; a runtime that
#       hardcodes bit 1 (value 2) then reads every static Swift class as
#       isTypeMetadata()==false -> mangled reflection names, and is the root of
#       0005's superIsTypeMetadata==0. Confirmed safe on real 10.9.5 (pure-objc
#       classes leave data low bits free). This is the ROOT fix 0005 symptom-patched.
